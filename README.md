## 编译命令

1. 首先装好 Linux 系统，推荐 Debian 11 或 Ubuntu LTS


2. 安装编译依赖
   ```bash
   sudo apt update -y
   sudo apt full-upgrade -y
   sudo apt install -y ack antlr3 asciidoc autoconf automake autopoint binutils bison build-essential \
   bzip2 ccache cmake cpio curl device-tree-compiler fastjar flex gawk gettext gcc-multilib g++-multilib \
   git gperf haveged help2man intltool libc6-dev-i386 libelf-dev libglib2.0-dev libgmp3-dev libltdl-dev \
   libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline-dev libssl-dev libtool lrzsz \
   mkisofs msmtp nano ninja-build p7zip p7zip-full patch pkgconf python2.7 python3 python3-pip libpython3-dev qemu-utils \
   rsync scons squashfs-tools subversion swig texinfo uglifyjs upx-ucl unzip vim wget xmlto xxd zlib1g-dev
   ```

3. 下载源代码，更新 feeds 并选择配置

   ```bash
git config --global http.sslverify false

git config --global https.sslverify false

git clone -b master  https://github.com/whfweb/openwrt.git
   
cd openwrt

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libncurses5-dev gawk git libssl-dev gettext zlib1g-dev swig unzip time rsync python3 python3-setuptools
   
   ./scripts/feeds update -a
   
   ./scripts/feeds install -a
   
   make menuconfig
   ```

4. 下载 dl 库，编译固件
（-j 后面是线程数，第一次编译推荐用单线程）

   ```bash
   make download -j8
   make V=s -j1
   ```


二次编译：

make clean     仅仅是清除之前编译的可执行文件及配置文件，比如bin路径下面的文件，config配置文件不会清除。
make distclean 清除所有生成的文件，连feeds也会干掉，只留下git clone完成时候的初始状态。
make -j$(($(nproc) + 1)) V=s

```bash
cd openwrt
git pull
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a
make defconfig
make download -j8
make V=s -j$(nproc)
```

如果需要重新配置：

rm -rf ./tmp && rm -rf .config



make clean      
make distclean

OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead
of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully
writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the
application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you
to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application.
For developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having
to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for
full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.

Sunshine!

## Download

Built firmware images are available for many architectures and come with a
package selection to be used as WiFi home router. To quickly find a factory
image usable to migrate from a vendor stock firmware to OpenWrt, try the
*Firmware Selector*.

* [OpenWrt Firmware Selector](https://firmware-selector.openwrt.org/)

If your device is supported, please follow the **Info** link to see install
instructions or consult the support resources listed below.

## 

An advanced user may require additional or specific package. (Toolchain, SDK, ...) For everything else than simple firmware download, try the wiki download page:

* [OpenWrt Wiki Download](https://openwrt.org/downloads)

## Development

To build your own firmware you need a GNU/Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack of a
case sensitive file system.

### Requirements

You need the following tools to compile OpenWrt, the package names vary between
distributions. A complete list with distribution specific packages is found in
the [Build System Setup](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem)
documentation.

```
binutils bzip2 diff find flex gawk gcc-6+ getopt grep install libc-dev libz-dev
make4.1+ perl python3.6+ rsync subversion unzip which
```

### Quickstart

1. Run `./scripts/feeds update -a` to obtain all the latest package definitions
   defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run `./scripts/feeds install -a` to install symlinks for all obtained
   packages into package/feeds/

3. Run `make menuconfig` to select your preferred configuration for the
   toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run `make` to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build the
   cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the GNU/Linux kernel & all chosen
   applications for your target system.

### Related Repositories

The main repository uses multiple sub-repositories to manage packages of
different categories. All packages are installed via the OpenWrt package
manager called `opkg`. If you're looking to develop the web interface or port
packages to OpenWrt, please find the fitting repository below.

* [LuCI Web Interface](https://github.com/openwrt/luci): Modern and modular
  interface to control the device via a web browser.

* [OpenWrt Packages](https://github.com/openwrt/packages): Community repository
  of ported packages.

* [OpenWrt Routing](https://github.com/openwrt/routing): Packages specifically
  focused on (mesh) routing.

* [OpenWrt Video](https://github.com/openwrt/video): Packages specifically
  focused on display servers and clients (Xorg and Wayland).
